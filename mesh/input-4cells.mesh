MFEM mesh v1.0

# Input file for RhoLo based on MFEM mesh file format
# This file was create on Sun 24 Oct 11:15:59 BST 2021 and can be visualised using GLVis
# See https://mfem.org/mesh-format-v1.x for description of this format
#
# RhoLo uses the following which may be inconsistent with MFEM:
#   element attribute for material number (column 1 in elements block)
#   boundary attribute for mesh side, =0 for bottom, 1 for right, =2 for top, =3 for left (column 1 in boundary block)
#   boundary type not used - it is not known what MFEM uses this for (column 2 in boundary block)
#   FiniteElementCollection not used - but MFEM may use this to set polyhedral order (in nodes block)
#
# The following format is interpreted by RhoLo
# dimension
# <number of spatial dimensions of the mesh>
#
# elements
# <number of elements>
# <material number> <element type from MFEM geometry type list, see below> <node number of vertices>
#
# boundary
# <number of element sides on the mesh boundary>
# <element side coincident with mesh edge> <boundary condition, 1=free surface, 2= forced-reflective> <node number of vertices on this side>
#
# vertices
# <number of mesh vertices>
# <serialisation, =2 for x,y pairs>
# <coordinate of vertex in each dimension>

# MFEM Geometry Types (see mesh/geom.hpp):
#
# POINT       = 0
# SEGMENT     = 1
# TRIANGLE    = 2
# SQUARE      = 3
# TETRAHEDRON = 4
# CUBE        = 5
# PRISM       = 6
